# Chicago crimes prediction

(As part of CS 418 - Introduction to Data Science)

## Analysis and prediction of crimes in Chicago city

Crime is a significant social problem in the nation, affecting public safety, child development, and adult socioeconomic status. A police officer may know where the dangerous/unsafe areas are according to his experience, but he may not be able to tell about the type of crime that can happen and when it can occur

### Big idea is to:

Help police officers to take preventive crime eradicating measures by providing useful information using a data-driven approach
Keep citizens aware of the possibility of a crime using the various trends observed
By predicting the number of arrests that can happen, the police department and government can be prepared well in advance to combat or arrange for the necessary real-estate

### Questions that are being solved

1. Will a future crime lead to an arrest, or no?
2. Predicting primary type of arrest going to happen in a location
3. Prediction of crime rate severity based on time and location

### Importance of DS to solve these questions

- Using data science, we can predict the future based on the past data
- There are multiple parameters that go into determining if a crime would lead to an arrest or no
- Just by merely analyzing the past trends, we cannot predict the exact possibility of an event occurring as the factors continuously vary from time to time
- By feeding the past data of a crime event such as crime type, crime time, crime location, severity of crime and so on, we can predict these values for a future time
